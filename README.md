In this repository I intend to share some implementations of ML and AI papers that I found particularly interesting. At this moment, these include:
1) [Toy Models of Superposition (2022)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) by researchers at Anthropic and Harvard. This paper studies several toymodels that exhibit the mechanism of 'superposition'. The authors argue that superposition might provide a suitable explanation for 'polysemanticity', which is the observed phenomenon that certain neurons in the neural networks are activated by completely unrelated features -- see the paper for a more extensive explanation. My notebook reproduces the model and some of the results (i.e. plots) from the paper and is written in a rather simple and easy to follow manner.
