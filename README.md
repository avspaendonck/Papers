In this repository I intend to share some implementations of ML and AI papers that I found particularly interesting. At this moment, these include:
1) [Toy Models of Superposition (2022)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) by researchers at Anthropic and Harvard. This paper studies several toymodels that exhibit the mechanism of 'superposition' (unrelated to the notion of superposition of QM!). Superposition the authros argue might be a suitable explanation for 'polysemanticity', which is oberserved phenomenon that certain neurons in the neural network are activatied by completely unrelated features -- see the paper for a more extensive explanation. My notebook reproduces the model and some of the results from the paper.
